## Features
#### User-Generated Sales Posts:
Users can create posts to list items for sale, providing details such as name, description, price, and images.

#### Administrator Approval Process:
To ensure quality and compliance, all user-submitted posts require administrator approval before appearing on the "Items for Sale" dashboard.

#### Advanced Search Functionality:
Buyers can easily find items using a powerful search feature that filters posts by name or content keywords, as well as by location, category, price and condition.

#### Post Editing:
Users can modify their posts to update details, such as price changes or additional information, even after submission.

#### In-App Messaging:
Users can communicate directly with each other through an integrated messaging system tied to specific items, enabling seamless negotiation and discussion.
